# Challenge Rate Limiter


# Dependencies
Here's what each of the above packages does in your project:
- express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- dotenv: Zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- cors: Express middleware to enable CORS with various options.
- helmet: Express middleware to secure your apps by setting various HTTP headers, which mitigate common attack vectors.
- axios: A promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase).
- ts-node-dev: Restarts a target Node.js process when any of the required files change.
